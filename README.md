Morse Key
==========

This is a BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) enabled arduino sketch which allows for any BLE enabled Arduino device to act as a bluetooth keyboard interface for the purposes of pairing with iCom's Morse-IT mobile app.
Connect a TRS jack to the ground, and two digital pin of your arduino, update the sketch to ID the pins selected, and a morse key can be plugged in and used to key into the app.
